        <p>Former Richmond player Kevin Sheedy started as head coach in 1981. Essendon reached the Grand Final in 1983, the first time since 1968. Hawthorn won by a then record 83 points.</p>
        <p>Following the 1991 season, Essendon moved its home games from its traditional home ground at Windy Hill to the larger and newly renovated MCG. This move generated large increases in game attendance, membership and revenue for the club. The club's training and administrative base remained at Windy Hill until 2013.</p>
