          A self-guided audio exhibition within the Queen Victoria Gardens, “Psychogeographical: A Melbourne dérive” is a trip on which to discover the unknown stories of familiar places. Taking place during MPavilion’s 2014 summer, the exhibition constructs a territory that utilizes synchronous narratives to punctuate the experience of objects, events and encounters with memory, reason and humour.
