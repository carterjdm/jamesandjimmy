        <p>A Big Salad is a summery arrangement of fruit-colored forms, mixed together and garnished to taste. Colorful swirls of columns lean together, while gold fruit finials adorn the tops. Collectively, they dance around a middle ground, converging into a ring—not a perfect circle, more like a gathering, spinning around while standing still. The 64-foot diameter “ring” consists of seven arcs of evenly spaced columns, chained into a spiral. Each arc has its own slightly different tilt and its own color, which cuts into the next, like slices of fruit. Like any good salad, A Big Salad brings together all the ingredients for a memorable performance and shakes them up.</p>
