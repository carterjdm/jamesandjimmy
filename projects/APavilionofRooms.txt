        <p>A founding member club of both the Victorian Football Association, in 1877, and the Victorian Football League (renamed the AFL in 1990), in 1896, Essendon is one of Australia's best-known football clubs.[2] Essendon has won 16 VFL/AFL premierships, which, along with Carlton, is the most of any club in the competition. The club won four consecutive VFA premierships between 1891 and 1894, a feat unmatched in VFA/VFL history.</p>
        <p>The club was founded by members of the Royal Agricultural Society, the Melbourne Hunt Club and the Victorian Woolbrokers.[3] The Essendon Football Club is thought to have formed in 1872 at a meeting it the home of a well-known brewery family, the McCrackens, whose Ascot Vale property hosted a team of local junior players.[4]</p>
