            In 1960 Bubblewrap was invented by pneumatically filling shower curtains into a gridded field of bubbles. That same year, Buckminster Fuller and Shoji Sadao proposed to cover New York with just one (Fig. 1).

            Unlike the metropolis’ monumental enclosure, Bubblewrap covered its object in a dependability of expendability. The multiplicity of air pockets ensured each sheet lasted long after one pop. Yet for all the bubblemania of the sixties, the bubble’s pluralistic composition remained singular. The architects seemed to take all the air out of the room.
