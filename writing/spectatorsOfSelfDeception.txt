            As an adolescent in the early 1990s who devoted himself to daily television like a monastic monk would religion, the workings of the rear projection television appeared obvious to me, except for one thing. Happy Days, that blissful 1970s replica of 1950s American life, appeared like another world, irrelevant to my upbringing in Australia. Sitting in the living room across the other side of the world, the show was characteristic for its simple hilarity of the American life of Richie Cunningham. Typical scenes staged the characters surrounded by an indistinct warm light, never depicting any of the dark hues or deep corners I knew to be true of the greater reality of life. Scenes garnered with this hazy light made one automatically think each was fabricated on a flat set in the misty Californian sun (Figs. 1 & 2).

            Yet it wasn’t necessarily the lighting or the color that left the images wanting. There was something lacking in the haze of fabricated Californian sunshine; there was less of something. Less detail, less shadow, less feeling. The scenes, lightened by the synthetic buoyancy of pastel col­ors, remained devoid of true darkness or uncertain­ty; a lack of depth that added to the unassuming merriment of the show.

          <h4>A Way of Seeing</h4>

           The television in our Australian living room was a rectangular box; four feet by four feet and as deep as the vanity table that held it. Typical of its time, the box was covered in a faux timber veneer and was punctured by a rounded grey glass screen. In retrospect, the screen’s concave face and round­ed corners gave it a bizarre three-dimensionality compared to contemporary televisions. The glass screen was in fact a truncated pyramid from whose apex, inside the television box, projected the images we dined on. The projections on the screen appeared flat but the surface itself had depth; the hollowness of the glass pyramid jarred my concep­tion of flatness.

            When the television was turned on, they were there: Fonzie, Richie Cunningham, and the rest, illuminated in that bright haze on the surface of the screen. The graininess, the opaque quality, and the perennial streams of pastels all confined this replica of reality to a picture frame. The projections of Happy Days would transform the grey glass of the television into Debord’s spectacle on a flat plate, which was devoured along with the family meal in front of us. Just as McLuhan would inform me of later in life, Happy Days was the anesthetic to numb ourselves until bedtime, and we watched as the years passed, openly oblivious to how this project­ed world differed from our own in its detail. Like pigs in front of a feeding trough, the quality of this primitive technology mirrored the total permissive­ness with which it was digested.
