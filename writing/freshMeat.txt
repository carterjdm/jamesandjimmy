           <h4>Fake Fiction</h4><br>
           <h6><i>Editors: Jamie Goldsborough, Juan Suarez and Jimmy</h6></i><br>
           <p>In a moment when the very idea of reality was challenged, "Fake Fiction" offered a critical understanding of the present; a double negative disconnected from the real and its often unfathomable nature. What is presented in this journal through the term Fake Fiction is an attempt to bring into question architecture, and its representation, through a negation of its fiction. </p>
